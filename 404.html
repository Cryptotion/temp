                </strong>
                <p class="card-text">
                    ZED is a comprehensive initiative by the Indian government to promote quality manufacturing and
                    eco-friendly processes among Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). The certification
                    encourages MSMEs to adopt best practices that ensure their products are of the highest quality
                    ("Zero Defect") while minimizing their impact on the environment ("Zero Effect"). It aligns with the
                    vision of making India a global manufacturing hub by helping MSMEs achieve world-class standards in
                    production, sustainability, and competitiveness. <br> <br>

                    ZED Certification offers multiple benefits to MSMEs. Firstly, it enhances their market credibility,
                    allowing them to compete on a global stage by meeting international quality standards. Secondly, the
                    certification enables MSMEs to optimize their processes, reduce wastage, and adopt energy-efficient
                    methods, ultimately lowering operational costs. This also helps businesses transition to more
                    sustainable, environmentally conscious operations, which is increasingly demanded by consumers and
                    global trade partners. <br><br>

                    Moreover, ZED-certified MSMEs enjoy various incentives such as easier access to credit, subsidies
                    for certification, and priority in government tenders. These benefits not only reduce financial
                    constraints but also foster innovation and capacity building within the sector. MSMEs also receive
                    training and handholding support during the certification process, ensuring they can continually
                    improve their operations and product quality. <br><br>

                    By obtaining ZED Certification, MSMEs can unlock new opportunities for growth, contribute to India’s
                    economic progress, and play a pivotal role in achieving the nation’s vision of becoming a global
                    manufacturing leader. For businesses seeking long-term sustainability, competitiveness, and market
                    leadership, ZED Certification is a powerful tool that fosters excellence and responsible growth.

            <ol style="margin: 15px;">
                <li>
                    Lean Manufacturing Techniques: MSMEs are guided in the implementation of techniques such as 5S,
                    Kaizen, Value Stream Mapping, Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), and Just-in-Time (JIT). These
                    techniques help in optimizing production processes, minimizing wastage, and improving operational
                    efficiency.
                </li><br>
                <li>

                    Expert Guidance: Under the scheme, MSMEs receive technical and managerial support from qualified
                    consultants who provide hands-on training and guidance. This includes assistance in identifying
                    areas of improvement and executing lean methodologies.
                </li><br>
                <li>

                    Cluster Approach: MSMEs are organized into groups or clusters to facilitate collective learning and
                    cost-sharing for implementing lean practices. This approach also fosters collaboration and knowledge
                    sharing among MSMEs in similar sectors or regions.
                </li><br>
                <li>

                    Financial Support: The government provides financial assistance of up to 80% of the cost for lean
                    manufacturing consultant fees, making it easier for MSMEs to adopt these practices without a
                    significant financial burden.

                        Cost Reduction:
                    </strong> Lean practices focus on eliminating waste and optimizing resource utilization, leading to
                    reduced production costs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong> Improved Quality: </strong> By refining processes, MSMEs can enhance the quality of their
                    products, making them more competitive in both domestic and international markets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong> Increased Efficiency: </strong> Lean techniques help MSMEs streamline their operations,

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong> Sustainability: </strong> The focus on resource efficiency and waste minimization
                    contributes to more sustainable manufacturing practices, aligning with global environmental
                    standards.

                Adopting lean manufacturing through this scheme not only makes MSMEs more competitive but also positions
                them as reliable players in the supply chain, capable of delivering high-quality products on time. It
                improves their ability to meet international standards, opening doors to global markets and boosting
                their contribution to India's economic growth.
